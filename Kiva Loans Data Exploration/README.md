# Reflection
This was my 2nd project and data exploration was surprisingly easy after having done multiple other projects before hand. Learning by doing is the best.

It is not yet finished as I plan to perhaps do a classification or Naive Bayes on the tags column to predict the tier of loan amounts. 

Will update machine learning soon.
