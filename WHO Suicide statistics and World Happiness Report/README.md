# WHO Suicide Statistics and World Happiness Report

is my first ever data science project. In this project, I explore the datasets:
https://www.kaggle.com/szamil/who-suicide-statistics
https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness

to find insights to the suicides around the world, as well as whether factors affecting happiness also affects suicides.

## Reflection

In this project, I mostly learned from looking at existing notebooks on kaggle, applying the code while reading Seaborn documentation. I thorougly enjoyed finding out that there can always be a more elegant method of writing code.
